# If this variable is true, the image is started on import, it sets a generated
# password for all users on the image and stop it.
# This is highly recommended for security reasons on production environments at
# the cost of adding around 10 to 30 seconds to the importation process.
# On development environments, this is not necessary if you have a well
# configured firewall.
