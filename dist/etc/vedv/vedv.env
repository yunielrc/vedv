# Starts the image on import, sets a generated password for all users
# on the image and stop the image.
# This is highly recommended for security reasons on production environments at
# the cost of adding around 10 to 30 seconds to the importation process.
# On development environments, this is not necessary if you have a well
# configured firewall.
